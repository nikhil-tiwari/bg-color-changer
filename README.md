# Background Color Changer

The **Background Color Changer** is a simple React-based application that allows users to dynamically change the background color of the webpage. The app provides a smooth and interactive user experience with multiple preset color options, built with Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Background Color Change**:
   - Users can select from a variety of preset colors, including Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Orange, Violet, Emerald, and Teal, to change the background of the webpage.
   - A "Default" button allows users to easily reset the background color back to the default dark theme (`#171717`).

2. **Interactive Buttons**:
   - Each button features a smooth hover effect and transitions to enhance the user experience.
   - Clicking on a button immediately changes the background color without the need for page reloads.

3. **Built with React**:
   - The app uses React's `useState` hook to manage the background color state dynamically.
   - The app is structured using clean, functional components to ensure maintainability and scalability.
